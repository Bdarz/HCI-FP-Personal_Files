Part B. Implementation of 6 Design Patterns from GL

1. Navigation
   Before:
   <img width="1920" height="1080" alt="B_Navigation_Before" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1aa61a5-6ae3-4849-913c-ec93d09f43dd" />

   After:
   <img width="1920" height="1080" alt="B_Navigation_After" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff89040c-b2b7-4854-ab64-570ebf2b98bd" />

   I introduced a progress bar, a number count, and breadcrumbs. This applies the design pattern of navigation, where hopefully, the user will be able to know where they are in the website and in the page itself. This solves the problem of users being lost and forgetting or not knowing where they are, and from these additions, hopefully users will be able to interact navigate through the app better.
   
2. Input and Forms
   Before:
   <img width="1920" height="1080" alt="B_Input_Before" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/72825aee-fd45-4e61-bcbd-583896cf5793" />

   After:
   <img width="1920" height="1080" alt="B_Input_After" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ffe95003-1773-40bb-946e-23c10e71ae20" />

4. Feedback Status
5. Layout and Structure
6. Data Presentation
